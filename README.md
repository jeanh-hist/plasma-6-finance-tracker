Plasma 6 Finance Tracker based on Yahoo Finance
By: Jean Viana

I ain't really a coding guy so it might be hella bugged. Did so because I missed a stock tracker as I used to have on Cinnamon.

Feel free to make changes, comments and whatever.

How to use:
1 - download the kde-finance-tracker tar.gz
2 - extract it anywhere
3 - run install.sh
4 - open edit mode
5 - add the Finance Tracker widget
6 - open configs and add your tickers
